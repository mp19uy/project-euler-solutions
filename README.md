Project Euler: http://projecteuler.net/ 
 
These are my solutions to the problems, programmed in python. 
 
Inside the code there is a brief description (commented) of what extra knowledge was used in order to solve the problem. 
Also, for some problems I found more than one solution. 

*SPOILER ALERT* 
If you are solving project euler's problems by yourself, I DO NOT ADVISE to read my solutions until you find yours. 
The entire project aims to help you to learn with these challenges. 
It would be like if I told you what happens at the end of the movie when you are entering the cinema.
